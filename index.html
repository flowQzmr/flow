      <h3>History of DoS</h2>
      <p class="history" id="history">
        "DoS" redirects here. For the family of computer operating systems, see DOS. For the United States federal executive department, see United States Department of State. For other uses, see DOS (disambiguation).
        In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled. The range of attacks varies widely, spanning from inundating a server with millions of requests to slow its performance, overwhelming a server with a substantial amount of invalid data, to submitting requests with an illegitimate IP address.

      <h3>How to protect your web-server</h2>
      <p class="defense" id="defense">
        All traffic destined to the victim is diverted to pass through a cleaning center or a scrubbing center via various methods such 
        as: changing the victim IP address in the DNS system, tunneling methods (GRE/VRF, MPLS, SDN), proxies, digital cross connects, 
        or even direct circuits. The cleaning center separates bad traffic (DDoS and also other common internet attacks) and only passes 
        good legitimate traffic to the victim server. The victim needs central connectivity to the Internet to use this 
        kind of service unless they happen to be located within the same facility as the cleaning center. DDoS attacks 
        can overwhelm any type of hardware firewall, and passing malicious traffic through large and mature networks becomes 
        more and more effective and economically sustainable against DDoS.
